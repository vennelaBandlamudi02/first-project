DevOps, as the name implies, is a combination of development and operations. 
DevOps can be best explained as people working together to conceive, build and deliver secure software at top speed. 
DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to work together. This results in continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.
